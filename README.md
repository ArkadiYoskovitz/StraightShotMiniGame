StraightShotMiniGame
====================

A small java game for the course, based on the Bulls and Cows children game.

for more on Bulls and Cows see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows

My version is a single player version build in java using the swing library.

Not all that exiting, but it was an academic exercise for one of my courses.

NOTE: Contains an example for a non jlable bases ListCellRenderer implementation, thats not that comman on line.

You're more then welcome to it.
